We have been working to gather citizen input to the creation of a citizens' charter for service delivery in Kampala --- an tool intended to enhance accountability.

As part of this work we have been able to get to learn about citizen input and citizen influence. In particular we get to ask:

* How can we best measure citizens’ degree of political power?
* How do gaps in voice relate to systemic responsiveness and ultimately unequal outcomes?

Through a close analysis of the Kampala citizen's charter construction process we assess linkages between three distinct  dimensions of political inequality:

* input: inequality in intensity of participation
* throughput: inequality in the system’s responsiveness to demands
* output: inequality in how much decisions favor specific individuals / groups
