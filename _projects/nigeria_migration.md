What drives people to make the dangerous journey across the Sahara?
Can the decision be explained by the logic of standard risk benefit calculations?
Do campaigns communicating the risks of these trips actually make a difference for the decisions of potential migrants?

Using a panel tracking decisions of potential migrants in Edo state together with a randomized dissemination on dangers of the trans-Saharan route we unpack logics driving the decisions of potential migrants.
