# 1 General Information

The focus of the course is close reading and re-analysis of emerging
research in the political economy of development, broadly construed. The
focus is on well identified research whether based on experimental or
observational data. It is intended for  students who already
have strong analytic skills.

# 2 Expectations

## 2.1 Reading

The reading loads are not especially heavy; typically 4 readings per session. You
should read these carefully <em>whether or not you are on the “rep” team</em> for the reading. There is no point
coming to the class unprepared. My thoughts on
<a href="https://macartan.github.io/teaching/how-to-read" rel="nofollow">reading</a>
and
<a href="https://macartan.github.io/teaching/how-to-critique" rel="nofollow">discussanting</a>.

book](https://book.declaredesign.org/integration.html#reanalysis)

## 2.2 Repping

Data should be available for all readings. For each reading a rep team will be assigned who is responsible for replicate results and submitting the results to robustness checks.


A “rep” team (of up to six students) will be assigned a formal role and prepare oral and written commentary for the reading. You should expect to be on one rep team each session.

Key elements of this are:

-   Be sure you have the data, papers, and all you need at least a week in advance

-   Make sure you can make sense of the data and run a basic replication.
        
-   When you have a feel of things jot down a brief "pre-replication
    plan". What do you plan to look at? What do you expect to find? Post it to Moodle before engaging in reanalysis (honor code)


-   Then there are two ways to expand the analysis;

    -   One is to check for robustness. How much do things depend on the
        particular models or measurements?
    -   The second is to go more deeply into the logic of the
        explanation. This might sometimes require assembling more data,
        constructing new tests and so on.

-   Generate a presentation that

    -   presents the paper in general
    -   goes through the results and replication and
    -   goes through robustness and extensions
    -   does all this in quorto or rmarkdown so that speaker has content
        and code in a single file (great reference:
        <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/>)

-   (ideally) *contribute* your replication to a class package (I will share notes
    on how to do this)

-   I urge you also to try to use `DeclareDesgin` to formally
    characterize the research design in abstract terms and assess its
    properties

    -   Note that while we focus a lot on statistical replication and
        re-analysis there are many sides to a paper. Your presentation
        <strong>should not shy from discussing more fundamental
        conceptual or interpretational issues</strong> as appropriate.

## 2.3 Writing

You will be expected to write up a short research design (10 pages) containing (i) a
theoretical argument or motivation, (ii) a proposed empirical test of
that argument (iii) a formal design object and (iv) a discussion of
policy prescriptions that might result from the argument.

# 3 The Readings

The readings use a wide range of strategies including experimental strategies and a range of observational strategies including IV and RDD.
