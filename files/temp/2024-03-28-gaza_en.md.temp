Germany has become a bystander, if not an accomplice, to what by many accounts amount to war crimes against the Palestinian population in Gaza. In doing so, it has supported actions that threaten to weaken international institutions. It has supported a strategy that appears counterproductive to its own goals. And it has done so in an environment in which voices critical of this strategy have been marginalized. The German government rightfully condemned the brutal assault by Hamas and other armed groups on October 7th. Hamas carried out obscene attacks on civilians and continues to hold civilians hostage, including children. These acts and other terrible acts [violate international humanitarian law](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-rights-chief-war-crimes-committed-by-all-parties-israel-hamas-conflict-2024-02-29/#:~:text=GENEVA%2C%20Feb%2029%20\(Reuters\),responsible%20to%20be%20held%20accountable.). The horrific nature of the October 7 attacks and the real need to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens may help explain Israel's response and Germany's largely unconditional political and [military support](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-military-exports-israel-up-nearly-10-fold-berlin-fast-tracks-permits-2023-11-08/) for this response. But, they do not justify it. The strategy of unconditional support to Israel has failed and it is now time to change course. **Bystander to war crimes**. The situation in Gaza is horrific with, [according to the WHO](https://palestine.un.org/en/259667-rafah-%E2%80%98pressure-cooker-despair%E2%80%99-gaza-us-ambassador-un-stresses-vital-role-unrwa#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20100%2C000%20people%20in,World%20Health%20Organization%20\(WHO\)), close to 2 million displaced and an estimated 100,000 now dead, injured, missing or presumed dead, a majority of whom are children and women. Civilian infrastructure has been targeted, including health and cultural institutions, and in many places razed to the ground. As academic researchers, we deplore the [wholesale destruction of institutions of higher learning](https://theconversation.com/the-war-in-gaza-is-wiping-out-palestines-education-and-knowledge-systems-222055) in Gaza and the killing of scholars. A generation of children is likely [traumatized](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-children-traumatised-by-bombardment-with-ground-war-start-2023-10-21/). [Aid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/22/obstacles-to-gaza-aid-deliveries-visual-guide) has been blocked and Gaza faces a [famine](https://www.wfp.org/news/famine-imminent-northern-gaza-new-report-warns) and societal collapse.<sup>[^10]</sup> The [UN High Commissioner for Human Rights](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-rights-chief-war-crimes-committed-by-all-parties-israel-hamas-conflict-2024-02-29/#:~:text=GENEVA%2C%20Feb%2029%20\(Reuters\),responsible%20to%20be%20held%20accountable.) has deemed that Israel's actions, like those of Hamas, constitute war crimes. The German government acknowledges the situation as disastrous but has not acknowledged that this is a man-made disaster and not an inevitable or unforeseeable event. The horror in Gaza is a predictable result of the Israeli government's strategy, which is supported by Germany.<sup>[^11]</sup> Evidence of [war crimes](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-rights-chief-war-crimes-committed-by-all-parties-israel-hamas-conflict-2024-02-29/#:~:text=GENEVA%2C%20Feb%2029%20\(Reuters\),responsible%20to%20be%20held%20accountable.) since the beginning of Israel’s campaign has been documented in detail by international observers.<sup>[^12]</sup> It has also been documented by [Israeli soldiers](https://www.972mag.com/israeli-soldiers-looting-gaza/) and even the [Israeli Defense Forces](https://thewire.in/world/roaches-to-be-exterminated-israel-military-admits-running-racist-telegram-group-against-palestinians) (IDF) through numerous videos and images, shared widely via TikTok, Instagram, and other social media channels. Despite extensive evidence of violations of international humanitarian law, the German government has rarely, if ever, condemned these actions. For example, the German Chancellor has [denied the possibility that Israel would violate international law](https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-leaders-tackle-middle-east-war-aim-keep-up-ukraine-support-2023-10-26/) and while the Foreign Minister has repeatedly urged Israel to adhere to international law, she has avoided suggesting that Israel has failed to do so. We do not doubt the importance of working to support Israel’s security, but we believe that providing support for the wholesale destruction of a society, as is now unfolding before our eyes, is incompatible with German post-war values. Given the clear evidence of war crimes and the immense suffering in Gaza, it cannot be a question of turning a blind eye, legitimizing or humbly making pleas. Rather, the situation requires the naming and condemning of unlawful violence and destruction, and it requires a willingness to take measures that sanction and ideally prevent further violations of international humanitarian law. **Weakening of international institutions.** Germany’s post-war international engagement has been characterized by a commitment to strengthening the international rule of law by supporting international institutions and defending them against attacks. Israel's ongoing attacks against international institutions are inconsistent with this policy. The Israeli campaign has killed [UN](https://www.dw.com/en/israel-hamas-war-136-un-staff-killed-in-gaza-says-guterres/live-67809478) and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ([IFRC](https://www.ifrc.org/article/ifrc-three-palestine-red-crescent-members-killed-unacceptable)) staff; the [World Health Organization](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-says-who-colluding-with-hamas-by-ignoring-terrorist-use-of-gaza-hospitals/) has been accused of collaborating with Hamas; the UN Secretary General has been charged with [blood libel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/25/israel-says-it-will-ban-un-staff-after-secretary-generals-comments); and [UNRWA](https://jewishcurrents.org/the-campaign-to-abolish-unrwa) has been treated as an enemy that must be destroyed.<sup>[^13]</sup> These attacks have generally not been condemned by Germany. At the same time, Germany has also acted to protect Israel from criticism in international courts. The German government’s [statement](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/erklaerung-der-bundesregierung-zur-verhandlung-am-internationalen-gerichtshof-2252842) on the [case brought to the International Court of Justice](https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20231228-app-01-00-en.pdf) (ICJ) by South Africa suggested, prior even to the presentation of evidence, that the case was "[completely unfounded](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/erklaerung-der-bundesregierung-zur-verhandlung-am-internationalen-gerichtshof-2252842)." While Germany reaffirmed its support for the ICJ after the initial ruling, its actions continue to be at odds with such support. On 26 January, following the ICJ decision, Germany [announced](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/newsroom/news/-/2641614) it would take “immediate measures to enable the provision of more humanitarian assistance to Gaza”; yet on 27 January, Germany announced that it will not approve further funding for UNRWA following accusations—[without accompanying evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/01/unrwa-funding-pause-employees-october-7-hamas-attack-claims-no-evidence-un)—by Israel against a small number of UNRWA staff members. It did so, despite a [joint statement by UN agencies](https://www.wfp.org/news/joint-statement-iasc-principals-we-cannot-abandon-people-gaza) affirming the essential role of UNRWA in providing humanitarian assistance in Gaza. Instruments that the international community might deploy in other conflict settings, such as sanctions, intervention, or peacebuilding have not been considered in this case, likely in deference to Israel’s hostility to them. The question for Germany is: what cost is it willing to impose on the international institutions it has done so much to support, in order to protect Israel from criticism?  **Ends and means.** It has been argued that the high number of civilian casualties, though regrettable, is justifiable given the aims of destroying Hamas and the military options that are available given Hamas' tactics. Whatever the legal and moral validity of this argument—or its relevance for actions that seem more directly targeted against civilians, such as the blocking of humanitarian aid—there is little evidence from social scientific research to suggest that military campaigns of this form are likely to increase security for Israel in the medium to long term. On the contrary: the kind of abuses suffered by civilian populations, whether understood as targeted or “merely” as collateral damage, could give rise to deepened hostilities and radicalization. This is supported by research findings from studies in Northern Ireland, Vietnam, and Iraq.<sup>[^14]</sup> More broadly there is a contradiction between the vision that Germany has for peace in the region---founded on a two-state solution---and the stated positions of the current government of Israel, which reject a two-state solution. Germany is thus supporting a government whose goals it does not agree with. In supporting strategies that are inconsistent with its own goals, Germany is failing to live up to its historical responsibilities - both its special obligations towards Jewish populations and its general obligation to protect human rights. **Weakened public deliberation.** Germany’s support for Israel, operationalized as unconditional support for the government of the day, has been accompanied by a marked narrowing of the discussion in Germany, effectively insulating German leaders and the German public from exposure to critical voices at a time when this is most needed.<sup>[^15]</sup> A striking number of [Jewish voices](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/11/denouncing-critics-of-israel-as-un-jews-or-antisemites-is-a-perversion-of-history) that have been critical of German policy have been silenced or sidelined.<sup>[^16]</sup> Attempts to understand the history and the context have been dismissed as attempts to relativize. Criticisms of Israel have been re-interpreted as Israel-hate or antisemitism. Critical voices have been discredited, and scholars criticizing Israel have been dismissed.<sup>[^17]</sup> In the German context, the important—critical—goal of combating antisemitism, has been implemented with a seeming confusion over what antisemitism is, and how it can be combated. The [IHRA](https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism) working definition, which the German government has adopted, may contribute to the confusion as it fails to clearly define antisemitism and rather lists actions that might, but need not, imply antisemitism. A notable example arose after the Berlinale, where a joint Israeli-Palestinian team used the term apartheid and another team referenced genocide. Leading politicians from across the political spectrum including many government ministers denounced the Berlinale for antisemitism and Israel-hate, in that case putting the speakers in [danger](https://twitter.com/yuval_abraham/status/1762558886207209838).<sup>[^18]</sup> However, such careless usages of the term antisemitism makes the important fight against antisemitism (and also the fight against right-wing extremism) more difficult and avoids a serious substantive discussion of the issues that these critical voices are raising. German leaders have described Israel’s security as part of Germany’s *raison d’état* and some have interpreted it to mean that Germany should support the Israeli state even when it [disagrees with the specific actions it is taking](https://www.dw.com/de/merkel-untermauert-verantwortung-f%C3%BCr-israel/a-59460339). This, we have learned, is not an effective strategy. It has risked German complicity in violations of international humanitarian law, with little to no prospects for enhanced security for Israel in the medium to long term. Moreover, it has been insufficient to provide guidance in a setting where Germany has both a historic responsibility to act to protect Jewish populations and a responsibility to act to protect Palestinian populations that are manifestly not being protected by Israel, [despite Israel’s obligations under international law](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/131). As Germany so recently stated, the universal responsibility to protect is the “[cornerstone of our individual and collective commitment to prevent and respond to the most heinous international crimes](https://new-york-un.diplo.de/un-en/-/2604620).” This cornerstone is under threat. It is past time for the German government to champion the universal application of international law and protection of human rights even if this means condemning and sanctioning the behaviors of the government of the day in Israel, to take robust action to protect the citizens of Gaza, and to defend the voices of those on both sides who have worked and continue to work towards peace, equality, and dignity. # <a name="_1fob9te"></a> [^10]: There are serious concerns that Israel has used starvation as a weapon of war—by [hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid (Amnesty International)](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/02/israel-defying-icj-ruling-to-prevent-genocide-by-failing-to-allow-adequate-humanitarian-aid-to-reach-gaza/), by [not providing secure delivery of aid (UN special rapporteur)](https://twitter.com/profbensaul/status/1763320585827066264) and by stopping granting visas for international workers in humanitarian organizations (see [David Cameron](https://twitter.com/aliciakearns/status/1770824294240600253) and also statements by [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/02/26/israel-not-complying-world-court-order-genocide-case), [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/02/israel-defying-icj-ruling-to-prevent-genocide-by-failing-to-allow-adequate-humanitarian-aid-to-reach-gaza/), and [12 prominent Israeli human rights groups](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/11/israeli-human-rights-groups-icj-gaza-aid-ruling?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other)). [^11]: As early as 15 October 2023, [experts ](https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/)warned of risks of potential genocide; with further warning of dangers in [early December](https://contendingmodernities.nd.edu/global-currents/statement-of-scholars-7-october/). In early January, [Israe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/israeli-public-figures-accuse-judiciary-of-ignoring-incitement-to-genocide-in-gaza)[li scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/israeli-public-figures-accuse-judiciary-of-ignoring-incitement-to-genocide-in-gaza) accused their country’s judicial authorities of ignoring calls to genocidal acts and ethnic cleansing by influential public figures.

[^13]: Israel has also refused to cooperate with international investigations, including into what [happened](https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-forbids-doctors-from-speaking-to-un-group-investigating-oct-7-atrocities/) on 7 October, and has [prevented foreign media](https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/gaza-israel-sky-news-nbc-abc-b1141942.html) access to Gaza. At the same time Israel killed an unprecedented number of [Palestinian journalists and their families](https://www.icij.org/inside-icij/2024/02/over-75-of-all-journalists-killed-in-2023-died-in-gaza-war-per-cpj/).

We note one important study from [Chechnya](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20684590) that suggests that in that context, suppressive effects of indiscriminate violence dominate, though this study only examines outcomes within a 100 day window of attacks. [^15]: This issue was raised before recent events, for example by the historian [Ilan Pappé](https://www.telepolis.de/features/Die-deutsche-Position-zu-Palaestina-Zweimal-auf-der-falschen-Seite-der-Geschichte-7100035.html?seite=all). [^16]: As early as October 2023, a group of [Jewish artists, writers, and scholars](https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/freedom-for-the-one-who-thinks-differently/) wrote an open letter calling “on Germany to adhere to its own commitments to free expression,” among others (German version [here](https://taz.de/Offener-Brief-juedischer-Intellektueller/!5965154/)). At the same time, voices openly supporting violations of humanitarian law (e.g. collective punishment) have been tolerated and amplified (for instance [public figures](https://taz.de/Douglas-Murray-und-Nahostkonflikt/!5969863/) promoting an interview arguing that all Palestinians are responsible for October 7). [^17]: A prominent example is the canceling of the ceremony to award the Hannah-Arendt Prize for [Masha Gessen](https://www.fr.de/kultur/gesellschaft/journalistin-masha-gessen-deutschland-hannah-arendt-preis-eklat-92731175.html), because they drew analogies between Gaza and Jewish Ghettos under Nazi rule. More recently the Max Planck Society terminated the employment of [Prof. Ghassan Hage](https://www.forschung-und-lehre.de/management/max-planck-gesellschaft-trennt-sich-von-ghassan-hage-6228), apparently because of his criticism of Israel, and, again, for drawing comparisons between behaviors of the Israeli army and Nazi abuses.
