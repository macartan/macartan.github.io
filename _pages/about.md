I am a Professor of Political Science at <a href='https://polisci.columbia.edu/'>Columbia University</a> and director of the Institutions and Political Inequality group at the WZB Berlin. I work on the political economy of development. Ongoing research focuses on post-conflict development, ethnic politics, political authority and leadership, and democratic development with a current focus on the use of field experiments to study democratic decision-making in post-conflict and developing areas. I have worked in Chad, Ghana, Haiti, Indonesia, Liberia, Mali, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Uganda, and elsewhere. Recent work has appeared in the American Political Science Review, Journal of Development Economics, Science Advances, and elsewhere. I have written or coauthored books on ethnic politics, natural resource management, and game theory and politics. I am a former Trudeau fellow and scholar of the Harvard Academy.
