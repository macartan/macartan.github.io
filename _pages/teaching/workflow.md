# Principles

-   Always work from a folder where your work automatically backs up.

    -   Dropbox, Drive, many others

-   Have analysis files integrated with writing files

    -   `Rmd` fabulous for this
    -   Set it up so that you can quickly do reality checks on data and
        analysis

-   Be able to replicate all data work and analysis with one click

-   Outsource formatting.

    -   e.g. `tex` and `.Rmd` autimatically format. If you use Word, use
        their “Styles”
    -   Bibliographies: use bibtex or similar. Keep a file and reference
        like this `@putnam2000bowling` (in Rmd) which produces
        Putnam (2000) and handles the formatting. Other tools work
        similarly. Don’t do this by hand.

# Folders and files.

-   Have all files: writing, files, data files, additional analysis
    files or images, etc in a single directory with relative references

    -   Number your folders.
    -   Have few files in each folder.
    -   I label files with date: `20201005_paper.Rmd`
    -   Compile regularly and have a readable compiled file beside your
        work file
    -   Keep your main document clean and source in sections/modules;
        you can turn off sourcing if some segments are giving trouble
        (see sourcing in the file `1../2_2../Lecture.Rmd`)
    -   Have an archive folder `0_archive` and backup old copies
        regularly (not so important if you have good versioning)

# Tasks

-   Keep a to do list
-   If you use github it is great to use “issues” to keep track of to
    dos
-   Try to complete well defined tasks in one sitting. Work in chunk.
-   If you have a repetitive task there is probably a way to automate
    it: ask for help
-   If you have a conceptually hard task that you are not making
    progress on, stop, move away, and try it from a whole new angle
-   Order your tasks: figure out whether you work better linearly or
    doing parallel work.
-   Cross off tasks when done
-   Don’t be afraid to discard work
-   Be ambitious but don’t let the best be the enemy of the good.
