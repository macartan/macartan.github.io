How can we best measure citizens’ degree of political power?
How do gaps in voice relate to systemic
responsiveness and ultimately unequal outcomes?

Through a close analysis of the Kampala citizen's charter construction process we assess linkages between 3 different dimensions of political inequality:

* input: inequality in intensity of participation
* throughput: inequality in the system’s responsiveness to demands
* output: inequality in how much decisions favor specific individuals / groups
